Portfolio-KodNest-Assignment

A personal portfolio website built as an assignment for KodNest. This project showcases my skills, projects, and provides a way for visitors (e.g., recruiters) to contact me.
Technologies Used

HTML5 – For structure and content.
CSS3 – For styling and responsive design.
JavaScript – For interactivity (e.g., smooth scrolling, form handling).

Features

Responsive design (works on desktop and mobile).
Sections: Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact.
Contact form to allow visitors to send messages directly.

Future Enhancements

Integrate Supabase (PostgreSQL-based backend) to store contact form submissions in a database.
The supabase/migrations/ directory is prepared for schema migrations (e.g., creating a contacts table).

Add real-time notifications or an admin view to check submitted contacts.
Deploy to a live hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages).
